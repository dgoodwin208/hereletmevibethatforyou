A fun, interactive website inspired by "Let Me Google That For You" but for Phind.

## About

"Here, Let Me Vibe That For You" is a humorous tool that generates a link demonstrating how to use Phind to answer simple questions. When someone asks you a question that could be easily answered with Phind, send them a link from this site instead.

## How It Works

1. Enter a question in the search box
2. Copy the generated link
3. Share the link with someone
4. When they open the link, they'll see an animation of someone typing their question into a search box
5. After the animation completes, they'll be redirected to Phind with their question pre-filled

## Features

- Clean, minimalist interface
- Step-by-step animation showing search process
- Animated cursor and typing effect
- Direct redirect to Phind search with the question pre-filled
- Mobile-responsive design
